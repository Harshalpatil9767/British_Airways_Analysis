C gate boarding OK but nothing special for First Passengers. Latest BA version of first with only 8 suites with privacy doors. Comfortable seat with plenty of stowage. Good screen and good choice of IFE. Amenity kit good quality and bedding, pillows cushions and blankets all good. Excellent menu and food very well presented. Cabin crew could not have been more attentive and helpful without being obtrusive. On time departure and early arrival. Bags delivered relatively swiftly and priority tagged bags were first off. All in all one of the best BA First flights I’ve had in many years. Whilst not touching the Middle Eastern carriers BA First on this showing is easily the best way to cross the Atlantic.',\n",
       " 'Not Verified |  Very good service on this route BA2710 30th March. Cabin crew worked hard, particularly Ivka (?) who was on the go throughout the flight. Everything you would expect of BA (and as it used to be!) Shame the same cannot be said on our recent flight back from Singapore, in Business Class on 11th Feb BA12. Miserable, unhappy and tetchy crew. Too lazy to do anything except sleep! Perhaps BA need to promote some of their short-haul performers, and let the others go.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |   Flight mainly let down by a disagreeable flight attendant. No queue to check in at Cape Town - good. However checkin agent was unfamiliar with BA size and weight rules for sports bags so had to wait 10 minutes while phone calls were made -- annoying. Lounge was good. Gate service was excellent with organised queues. Seat was good (the new upgraded Club Suite). The zip broke off the amenity kit so it was unusable -- BA cutting corners too much here. Offered a cocktail service which came promptly and the drink was excellent. But no nuts! So I went off to the galley to ask for some nuts or a snack to go with it. I spoke to a male flight attendant who looked at me with utter distaste that I had the temerity to ask for nuts. The he said \"where have you come from?\". What a bizarre question. I said \"seat 8E\" to which he responded with a flick of his hand - \"go ask her, she\\'s serving you.\" I was stunned - I have not been treated that way in even the cheapest restaurants, let alone business class on a premium airline. The gentlemen concerned has no place in service or hospitality and should find a different line of work. Anyway, the food was good. The IFE worked fine. WiFi wasn\\'t working. I managed 6.5 hours sleep and we got off the plane promptly despite being at a remote stand, requiring a bus. The luggage took quite a while to arrive. Overall 7/10. Would be 9/10 but for the rude staff member.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |   Another awful experience by British Airways. This flight was delayed nearly 1 hour. British Airways charges an extortionate amount for their tickets but the service is bad for me.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |   The service was rude, full of attitude to me, the food is poorly serviced, the cabin during the flight was never cleaned in particularly the toilets.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |   This flight was a joke. There was four people in business class including myself and my companion. The service was outrageous. The crew was too busy flirting with the captain and where she was going for the day off, instead of paying attention in the cabin. ',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |\\xa0 \\xa0This time British Airways managed to get everything right. The price of the tickets was reasonable and the timing was perfect. Boarding was smooth and the seats were comfortable – easy reline to enable dozing and sufficient pitch to get in and out. The table was firm enough to allow the use of a small laptop and mouse. A pre-flight soft drink or Prosecco was offered and both the food and drink were more than sufficient. The best part was the cabin crew – two in PE and they were both extremely efficient, pleasant and witty. There was a good selection of movies and both the screen and the headset worked perfectly.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |   The seats were excellent, with a feel of much more room than the official seat pitch (I am 6ft 1in). We could sleep for a couple of hours (daytime flight), with the blinds down as they should be (no point booking a window seat in my view). I focus on seat quality much more than smiley faces and food (the food was middling, and the second meal, before landing, was distinctly sub-par).',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |   After the nightmare of getting through triple security at Nairobi Airport, I was looking forward to a glass of something lovely to unwind on the plane. Fat chance. An hour and a half after takeoff we were finally served a drink and meal together. I keep reading how well BA are now doing, but on both legs of this trip the crew were awful. The club suites are a great improvement but if the staff make no effort, what’s the point? On a positive note we were told my wife’s seat was broken and could not recline. I was going to swop, but at the gate they found her another. Prior to this we received an email within 30 minutes of check in with a healthy portion of Avios already added to our account. Well done customer service.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |   Prior to boarding a gate agent seemed to pick on elderly people and asked them to check in relatively small bags. By contrast the same staff member looked the other way to a boisterous group of 20 somethings all of whom had large amounts of luggage. London Gatwick to Marrakech with British Airways was rather disappointing. The flight is just over 3 hours and during this flight passengers in economy were offered a tiny packet of digestive biscuits. No water was offered other than a cabin crew member walking through the aisle with a bottle of mineral water and plastic cups. She claimed she ran out of water and so many passengers did not even get that miserly offering. There was no route map on this A320. The captain made only 2 very brief announcements. When I needed to use the lavatory one cabin crew member rudely drew the curtain as she was sitting behind the lavatories with one of her colleagues – they were loudly talking about their boyfriends and ignored an elderly man who was struggling to open the small door to the lavatory. I shall add that the lavatory was unclean and had water on the floor. One concern was the seemingly casual approach to the safety demonstration. Disembarkation was not well managed either. This route is very competitive and these days one has a lot of choice. I will not use British Airways on this route.',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |   I flew from Amsterdam to Las Vegas with a layover in Heathrow in November 2024. The day we were flying the weather wasn't great. Since I was on business I really needed to get to Las Vegas, we anticipated on it and checked early if our flight was still leaving. We would have had ample time to catch an earlier flight to Heathrow or even take the train when we checked. According to google our flight was delayed and we would miss our connection. According to the staff of British airways the flight was not delayed and there was no reason for panic. When we got to the airport there was still nothing wrong with our connection. An hour before we were supposed to leave it was announced that the plane wasn't there yet and we would have a major delay. We called customer service and they told us to just go to London and see from there. We wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those. In the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced British airways to book that for us. Even though they wanted to connect us through 3 additional layovers.. This resulted in approximately a 24 hour delay in our trip. On our way back home they lost our luggage at the gate and took approximately 2 hours to find it at a wrong gate. On the way back we tried to check in through the online portal. My colleague was able to check in just fine but I couldn't. I was afraid I was overbooked and contacted customer service 3 times.  When I got to the airport I was overbooked and the ground staff had the nerve to tell me it was my fault for not checking in online. Since we were seated in premium economy I could be moved to regular economy but that does mean someone in economy was bumped off the plane. When we got to London our flight back to Amsterdam was delayed. This was because there were disabled people on board of the plane still and there were not enough wheelchairs to get them off. It took approximately 2 hours before boarding could begin.  When we finally boarded we were told we needed a new pilot because the old pilot had now made too many hours waiting around to still fly us to Amsterdam. Arriving in Amsterdam they had left my luggage in Las Vegas so I needed to wait for another week before that was given back to me. Afterwards I have made a claim as soon as possible for my delays and hotel costs, it's been almost 3 months and they still haven't replied. Every time I contact them they claim they have such a huge backlog that it takes long to process them. \",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified | First the good news, the club suites are such a huge improvement over the old business seats I hope I never see one again. The not so good news I’m afraid to say was the flight itself. The food has really gone downhill since my last flight, presumably this is a cost cutting measure. If other airlines can offer a really decent quality meal why can’t an airline of BA’s stature? I’ve always thought that a good crew can make up for all the shortcomings but not this time. The crew member looking after me could not have been more bored and was obviously just going through the motions. They couldn’t even be bothered to say cheerio, and I’m not sure I would have answered if they did. Here’s hoping my return is a more satisfying experience.',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |   I have never travelled with British airways before and this is the first time I chose to travel with BA due to the cheapest fare available during this time but I was bit unsure if I can enjoy my travel journey due to mixed reviews. I would like to express my extreme joy and satisfaction travelling with this amazing airline. I haven't seen such a great, efficient and friendly service by the cabin crew. I would like to personally thanks Ellie and Adam who were not only very professional but very kind too. Food served was delicious and the drinks were good too. I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed this flight and do not hesitate to recommend to anyone to try it\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified | Terrible overall, medium service and the flight was delayed. There was no help at all to reschedule a connecting flight. The customer support was terrible and the request for compensation is still pending after one year.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |   London Heathrow to Male In new business class. BA continues to get its mojo back starting with a classy lounge serving innovative, and interesting, quality pre-flight food (beetroot scotch eggs?). Excellent wine (Whispering Angel). Presentation of on-board food has always been a bit hit and miss with BA, but on this occasion it was tasty and OK. Friendly and efficient on board crew. Smile, treat them respectfully, and as equals.  On time flight and early arrival.  Only awarding a 9 because we were bussed from A-C gates, otherwise a really enjoyable experience.',\n",
       " 'Not Verified |  Very good flight following an equally good flight to Rome. Good food (especially on an evening flight) and aircraft early both ways. Just what short haul should be.',\n",
       " \"Not Verified |  An hour's delay due to late arrival of the incoming aircraft. The captain was a particularly able communicator who kept us in touch with the situation. We got freebie upgrades to emergency exit seats from a friendly member of the crew. In the end we were only 30 minutes behind schedule in a relatively comfortable elderly plane. Pretty stress free.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |   I booked through BA because Loganair don’t have representatives in Manchester airport. Loganair cancelled the flight but someone at BA marked the flight as delayed by 52 minutes. I’ve spent over 70 days chasing BA’s complaints department who are at best totally ineffective. They won’t put you through to the people dealing with the claim (apparently they don’t have the facility to do so!), they won’t phone Loganair, they won’t look on Manchester airports historic flight website to confirm the cancellation, they won’t put you through to a supervisor in fact they do very little but apologise for how little they do. ',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |   British airways lost bags in LHR then found them. Sent to Cologne where it sat for two days before they told me, but no one was there to give it to me. I spent 10 days in Europe without a bag, bought clothes. BA refused to reimburse me. They closed the case 10 days after i returned to the states when my bag showed up at my front door. They wont let you talk to management, they say they email mail you but they don't then you call customer service. they say they will escalate it but you will never know. they don't update the claims or the forms. \",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified | The check in process and reward/loyalty program is a mess. I am never able to get points, even when trying it through a partner airline. Unfortunately for work I have to travel with them sometimes.  This time, the flight was delayed.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |   We flew in November 2023, but it took this long to seek a satisfactory response from BA, which we ultimately never received. BA refused to re-book my son and me at no cost that day due to lack of Underground service / alternate service. BA forced us to buy new tickets and never admitted that they subjected us to disparate treatment. I will not be flying or recommending BA again.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified | I left for London from Johannesburg at 21:15 on 22 December 2024. My only issue with that flight was the pillows they gave us were dirty and when my 7 year old dropped some juice and I asked a cabin crew member walking past for some serviettes she told me to go to the bathroom to get some to clean it up. Those issues weren’t pleasant but certainly not a major problem. I was booked on the BA0057 at 21:15 on 31 December 2024 to return to Johannesburg. The flight was delayed to the 1 January 2025 at 12:00pm. I had a connecting flight to Durban and do not live in Johannesburg. Landing in Johannesburg with 3 children at 1 am was not an option for me. BA changed my flight to 2nd January 2025 at 18:25. I requested a sooner date so I could get home sooner. I was given 1 January 2025 at 21:15. I accepted this as this is the original time I opted for and would he most convenient for me as I was doing a connection in Johannesburg to Durban. Unfortunately this flight was delayed till 2nd January at 17:00. I was extremely upset by this as I was absolutely exhausted and had 3 children who were absolutely exhausted. I also suffer from eczema and hay fever and did not have my creams and medication. This caused my eczema to flare up so badly, even my lips were cracked and burning. My allergies were so severe that my eyes were sticking together and I couldn’t stop sneezing. My daughter also has eczema and has had a flare up. The staff had no sympathy or empathy for a mother traveling alone and her children. I was just told that they know it’s an inconvenience and a lady even snapped at me that they trying their best. My children are 4, 7 and 11 and we were all booked on separate seats. Is that even legal let alone ethical? They were refusing to help me and saying they can’t do anything. I approached 3 people, and the third person finally put us together. So they could clearly help me??? My flight from Johannesburg to Durban was originally booked on South African Airways and I paid a lot for this ticket as South African Airways is not a low cost airline. I was given a cheap low cost Airline, CemAir, which I had never even heard of, to replace my SAA flight. I suffer from flight anxiety and this is why I never book low cost airlines with tiny flights. My anxiety went through the roof on the flight! Besides all of this, I am also left with a huge credit card bill as I used up all my pounds on the 1st! I know BA is obliged to compensate me for the inconvenience under EU law but besides the compensation BA staff really needs to show more empathy for their passengers, like me, who had two hours long flight delays two days in a row and was alone with 3 children. I expect my full compensation for all of us as this has been by far the worst experience I have had traveling. All their staff kept saying is “that’s why you will get compensation.” I am now waiting to see if I get compensated as I was promised by all of their ground staff! Legally they have to under EU law, so let’s see if they put up a fight or do what is ethical and legal.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |   After an excellent flight on a 777 CPT to LHR the return was not as good. BA have moved the Business Class checkin from one end of the hall to the other at T5 for no apparent reason so a nice long walk to check in. Fast Track security was very slow (15 minutes). The indicator board suggested the South Lounge was \"half full\" but when I went it was uncomfortably full and it is still tatty as not refurbished, so I went to the B Pier lounge instead. Much better except as usual the staff are sort of trying to pack up early and have a bizarre way of refilling the food containers which involves actually removing them to the kitchen (which means they are gone a lot of the time) rather than replenishing them customer side. Very employee-centric behaviour. Time for the flight so down to the transit to take us to the C Gates. Except the transit had decided not to stop any more at the B Gates so we watched five maybe seven transits pass through without stopping. Eventually me and a group of maybe 15 other passengers of mixed ages decided to descend to the walkway and run all the way to the C Gates. We all arrived soaked in sweat - not a nice start to a long business class flight. The A380 is spacious but the seat is outdated now and in urgent need of replacement. IFE was not working and had to be rebooted. The headphone prong was bent so headphones not working. The USB port was not working. Drinks were brought out promptly. Starter (salmon) was delicious - truly excellent. Beef was tough ... I think a bad piece of meat rather than badly cooked. Wines were good. Cheese was average to good. Staff were friendly. Good night\\'s sleep. Breakfast good. The recheck experience at JNB is a huge hassle - there is a giant screen saying \"Domestic recheck\" and a queue but when you get to the front of the queue you are told it is SAFAIR only and not for SAA, BA\\'s local partner. What a hassle. Why aren\\'t we warned or told this ... loads of BA passengers making the same mistake. Overall 5/10. It\\'s the little things that would make this better: fast track actually fast track. Refurbish the South Lounge. Have food replenishment in the passenger area, not the kitchen; make sure the transits stop, even late in the evening; refurbish the A380s; ask Do & Co (who are generally excellent by the way) to monitor meat quality rigorously.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |   On a recent flight from Cyprus BA621 on 23/11/24, the second the cabin door was closed the pilot announced we would be held on the runway for 2 hours. They know this prior and did not inform passengers until after we had boarded. The flight home took nearly 6 hours due to weather conditions, this plus 2 hours waiting. What did BA offer during this 8 hour hell flight, 3 oatmeal biscuits and 250ml of water for our family. When I went to the cabin crew to ask for more water, which I was told there wasn’t any 3 out of the 4 cabin crew were asleep in the back row seats of the aircraft BA621 on 23/11/24. This infuriated me further as I had previously asked if there were any spare seats so that my 2 year old could spread out and get some sleep if available. I was told the flight was full. After we arrived late my connecting flight had now been missed. We then queued at the connections desk in a large queue only to watch the BA staff clock off for the night in front of us. No genuine support was given to me, or my family and we were effectively abandoned by BA. I’ve tried to speak to someone, but their helpline has an automated message saying due to the number of calls (not surprised by that aspect) they cant assist me, then hang up. Tried this several times at various times. I think it’s their default message. Have raised this via their email system. Unsurprisingly been mugged off and can’t escalate until 8 weeks have passed. Like I said a national disgrace. ',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |   Flight BA 0560 arrived in Rome on 11 December where ALL passengers received a SMS from BA to say that their luggage had been left in London.  My wife and I completed the required form but were in a queue for 2 hours to have it checked. BA’ s agent in Rome believe the baggage would arrive on the last flight that night (10pm) and would most likely be delivered next day. Nobody from BA in Rome Airport made contact with us to explain what happened and when bags would arrive. We finally got our luggage delivered to us at 4pm on Sunday 15 December - the day before we were due to leave Rome. During the waiting period there was no contact initiated by either BA or their Rome agents and on several occasions when we called both Rome and London help desks, we received no updates. In 34 years of travelling together this has never happened before and the sheer neglect in keeping us informed is disgusting. Sadly for BA, we will never fly with it again and will share our horror story with others and strongly encourage them to fly with another airline. I would give BA an overall rating of zero.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |   This was the first time I flew British Airways, and it was a huge disappointment. While the seat is quite good, the food is very simple and the service is subpar. But not only that, Heathrow airport, their hub, is by far the worst large airport I’ve seen in Europe. When we landed in DC I had an email saying that my luggage stayed in London. This was last Wednesday. I have an AirTag so I could follow my suitcase. It came to Washington the following day, Thursday. Ever since, it’s been sitting in the airport. British offers no means of communication: the online chat is a bot. The bot tells me to call a number in England. I did. It’s another bot. When you say you have in inquiry about luggage it sends you a link via SMS and hangs up. No option to talk to a human. In the claim form they gave me there’s a local phone, which reaches a voicemail. I keep calling them (6 times today only) and leaving messages, saying that the AirTag shows the suitcase in IAD and offering to go pick it up so they don’t need to deliver it. No one replies to the voicemail. So basically I am shut out, with no luggage, no information, no customer service and no one to talk to. ',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |   Pretty good flight but still some small things that can be improved. Check in was quick. Lounge was good - tasty food and well chosen wines. Disappointingly they had not secured a gate so we had to bus to the aircraft and it was all a hot scrum. I got the last bus to avoid the crush. Emirates, Turkish, Lufthansa, Qatar all had planes on gates ... why not BA? Penny-pinching? Then it turned out the cabin crew forgot about those on the last bus so I had to ask for a welcome drink. It came and the champagne was actually cold. Well done BA ... first time they managed to serve champagne cold in my 10 years of flying with them. Big improvement. Cabin and seat were lovely as always (I greatly prefer to the Emirates white/gold bling). Drinks service was prompt. IFE was good. Starter (trout) was OK. Main (chicken) was excellent. Cheese was sold not cold (as it should be). Wines were excellent. We were not disturbed through the night so got a good sleep on a comfy bed. Cabin was a bit too warm though for my personal preference. Was woken up (as asked) and served a tasty breakfast. Small detail - as it is impossible to get water to 100C at altitude maybe BA could warm the ceramic coffee cups so coffee retains its heat a bit longer? Pouring not quite hot coffee into a nice (but cold) china mug means it is lukewarm instantly. Off the plane in record time (2 minutes) after parking. Bags were waiting for us on the belt. Excellent work by the ground staff. Overall 8/10. Improvement points: gate not bus to the plane; don\\'t forget passengers on the last bus or who board late (but well before pushback). Standout cabin crew member was \"Miguel\" - what a star.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified | Check in was fine, but no priority/fast track lines for security or boarding. There is only one lounge option for first class customers in Mexico City, which is the American Airlines admirals club, which is abysmal. There is a free bar, serving cheap alcohol – an awful food selection – and nowhere to shower. On board – I find the seat really comfortable. The crew were fantastic, and I’m starting to really see some consistency in the quality of their first class crew. The drink selection was fine. The food was appalling. We were the victims of their new supper service. This is basically a dinner service with a lot less options/choice. No fish/seafood options on either the starters or the mains. First choice of Main unavailable as only two had been loaded. The fillet steak, so drying and overcooked, that I heard at least three people send it back. Pretty impressive for a cabin of just eight passengers..Dreadful dessert and cheeseboard. luggage off swiftly the other end – so good to see priority tagging working.',\n",

They've kept us at the gate saying the plane couldn't land while literally every plane from that airport was taking off and landing with zero issues. There was another KLM flight to Amsterdam scheduled to depart at the same time. It took off on time and another KLM flight to Amsterdam later the evening also took off without any problems. It's just the one operated by British Airways was cancelled because of 'the bad weather'. Apparently, the weather was so bad that every plane could land and take off successfully apart from theirs. I had to rebook myself on the Eurostar the next day and would still miss the important appointment that I intended to go to Amsterdam for. All thanks to British Airways.\",\n",

It's the insane saga of events that proceeded to claim the compensation that I'm legally entitled to according to EU rules. Used their claims page and all was OK. It was from there that it became incomprehensibly frustrating. My case was closed but no confirmation of what the conclusion was or any money. I tried calling but kept being lead in circles; customer services can't speak to the claims team, the claims team can't be spoken to directly, customer service don't have access to the claims team's system and so on. 4 calls later and 'nothing could be done'. I had to throw my toys out of the pram on the last call and someone finally updated me. I thought that was the end; they had confirmed the claim and that I would be transferred what I was due. And then, they got the amount wrong. I wrote to they to highlight this and they said that they would rectify it. Almost 1 month since the original flight was cancelled and still haven't received what is owed to me as compensation for my wife and son. I have sent two more emails in the last two days and I've yet to get a response. It is criminal that they are not adhering to the aviation rules that dictate compensation for cancelled flights. Terrible customer service and honestly can't belive that BA are capable of such awful service.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified | We have sat on this plane for an hour and forty five minutes awaiting takeoff due to bad weather in London. This is understandable for safety. Fortunately I have a long layover so this delay does not affect me. However many others are not so lucky. While waiting we were given one small bottle of water and one tiny pack of corn kernels. Later food and drink were offered for purchase. This is my complaint. After sitting idle on this plane for nearly two hours and possibly missing connecting flights they can’t give us a free bag of chips and a coke? When I asked I was told no. Is British Airways really this cheap and money grubbing?',\n",

We we told by airline employees to purchase any necessities (toiletries, refreshments, etc.) and we'd be reimbursed. That claim was denied, with BA claiming that weather was the reason for the delay (an outright lie since every other airline in London was flying on-time). We were unable to to anything besides stand in lines for vouchers, stand in lines for shuttles, stand in line for reservations, etc. for 48+ hours. It was an absolute nightmare and I will never fly BA again.\",\n",

It was a quiet flight so I say myself at the emergency exit unchallenged which was handy. Would fly again with BA where pressed.',\n",

Onboard services are also archaic and outdated and the planes are the oldest out of any airline I’ve flown with. Food and service was the worst I’ve ever experienced and I’ve travelled on most airlines (Emirates, Etihad, Thai, Malaysian, Qantas, Cathay, UA etc). DO NOT FLY WITH BA.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |   Disappointing service, plane interior and terribly incompetent customer service I booked my flight directly through BA\\'s website. Soon after I started to get emails saying my selected seats (I paid extra for the selection) had been changed by BA without any reason given and I was directed to the website. There I found no information on the said seat change. This happened several times (I had 4 flights altogether). The website seems to be a digital dinosaur. The first leg of my flight was fine, until I discovered in the transfer area at Heathrow that I forgot my new laptop onboard. Immediately I contacted BA\\'s so called Customer Service (what an oxymoron), which basically said they can not do anything, I would have to wait until the cleaners (working for a contractor) would have finished their job and hope they would discover the laptop and return it to so called Lost & Found at the airport. BA\\'s customer service said they couldn\\'t contact their colleagues in the terminal/gate were the plane was still and let them know there was a lost laptop by seat no 27A of the plane (yes I told them exactly were the laptop was). They wouldn\\'t take any contact details either to notify me if and when the laptop would be returned and they refused to register the incident. They simply had no interest in assisting me and didn\\'t even make an attempt to pretend they did. Communication via their online customer service was poor, and they didn\\'t even respond to my messages. In the end I emailed the representative at Heathrow and he replied with a message form his supervisor (which did not reveal his name): \"It is not the duty of British Airways to find lost property on behalf of our passengers, however if you would like to dispute this you can contact customer relations online with further feedback.\" They took no responsibility and referred me to Smartecarte, which is the contractor cleaning their planes and apparently collecting lost items at Heathrow. I have not received the laptop, worth 2 thousand GBP, back now 3 weeks later. The flights between London and Cape Town (~12 hours), were unpleasant. The flight attendants were seemingly unenthusiastic about their job, it took up to an hour to collect the trash after the meal, which also was distributed extremely slowly. Food was not good. Boarding was slow and inefficient. Drinks were only offered twice (otherwise you\\'d have to ask for it especially) on this long flights. The seats were of fabric, uncomfortable and room too scarce to relax and sleep. All in all flying with British Airways was disappointing and I will not be keen on flying with them again. ',\n",

When we reach Iceland I emailed British Airways telling then she won't be using her return ticket and requested for a partial refund. 2 days later. I received an email from customer service that I need to contact one of their service centres via the provided link. I replied to say the link only goes to a page with various British landline phone numbers to call and explained that I am overseas then and it will not be practical to do this via international calls. They replied to say I can only do this by contacting the service centres. So the airline end up taking my money regardless. \",\n",

This to be later confirmed as one at 23 kg checked in, another 23 kgs carry on for under seat, and a third 23 kgs carry on for overhead stowage. Checkin opened a bit late, and the line for Executive Club members even later, but was courteous and efficient. Long queue for passport control but the fault of Brexit, not BA. My seat had no screen; no earphone socket; no charge point; no seat recline; no boarding music. All the same as low cost carriers. Captain announced \"Wonderful service from Emily and crew\" - maybe it was in Club Class, not the economy cabin. It was announced that they would serve complimentary water and snack, but only the snack came. It was also announced there would be free text messaging for Exec Club members, but I couldn\\'t get it to work, although a member. Snacks were sold, some at twice TUI price. For example Cadbury\\'s chocolate fingers at £3.50. I chose BA this time as when I booked it was cheaper than all the charter carriers. And being British I mustn\\'t forget BA\\'s impeccable safety record and normally reliable service. After landing the Purser thanked the crew for their hard work.

I had to rebook my tickets, and while the original journey was consisting of 3 legs, BA forced me to rebook the entire ticket, because their system did not allow them to rebook just that one leg (even though there was a gap of 13 days between the two legs, not like they were connecting flights). The telephone operator was rude, took 45 minutes and kept saying she needed 3-4 more minutes to give me clarity. It was horrendous. The final price they offered me for rebooking 2 of the 3 legs was much more than the original fare for all 3 legs. She was torturous, BA was horrendous because the website does not allow you to do all this. A very poor experience, in all.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |\\xa0 \\xa0Singapore to Heathrow with BA. Two choices on this route A380 or 777-300. In economy and premium (and first) there isn’t much in it. In club world the 777 wins as it has the suite. Check in was easy. Security and passport control in Singapore is efficient. Choice of 3 lounges (BA, Qantas or Qatar) the latter wins easily. BA lounge was ok no major negatives. Qantas wins on space. Boarding was on time. The aircraft has a high density club world cabin. Service was fine. Club suite was good. It’s the food and beverages that are being targeted I feel. The 1st meal starter was good, main of beef fillet was average, same sentiment for cheese. Wines were acceptable. Champagne choice is cheap so I did not try. Service for meals efficient given the full cabin. Breakfast was similar. The menu suggested that some might want to skip a main course and opt for starter and dessert, for this to work for BA, a major shift in how lounge options are sourced and presented would be needed. As it was I slept well, we arrived early, luggage off quickly (for once) so a reasonable flight overall. My warning to BA is that food and beverages in club world are drifting in the wrong direction',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |   I recently travelled from Munich to London with British Airways, and it turned into an absolute nightmare. Our troubles began with their malfunctioning app. Despite checking in successfully, I was unable to retrieve our boarding passes. Upon arrival at the airport, we discovered that there were no self-service kiosks, and the check-in desks were completely unattended. After seeking help from the information desk, we were directed to a staff member who clearly did not want to assist us. Her dismissive attitude was infuriating, and despite showing her the app indicating we were checked in, she simply told us to call customer service and walked away without providing any assistance. After being put on hold for 25 minutes and being sent to several different staff members who couldn’t help us, we finally reached someone on the phone who was kind but ultimately powerless to resolve our issue. By this point, our flight was delayed, and we had wasted two hours just trying to print our boarding passes. When I followed up with a complaint, British Airways basically dismissed my concerns and told me to use the app next time—ignoring the fact that it was the app's failure that caused all these problems in the first place! This experience cost us a staggering £682.43 in additional expenses, including new flights, hotel stays, taxi fares, and fines. Missing work and explaining this absurd situation to my employer was incredibly embarrassing. British Airways clearly needs to improve its customer service and technology. If their app and website are going to fail, they must provide adequate support at the airport. I will never fly with them again, and I urge others to consider alternative airlines.\",\n",
       " 'Not Verified |  I paid for seats 80 A and B on my flight from Heathrow to Boston on the A380, paying for premium economy seats. Upon arrival at the airport the ticket agent said I was not healthy enough to sit in the purchased seats due to being too old I presume (65) since there is no other reason I can find I could not sit in the exit seating. I am healthy enough to walk 10-12 miles a day and have adequate upper body strength. Attempting to convince her just got us stuck in a cattle call seat, at the rear of the aircraft, second floor and in the middle two seats of the row. We were told our money would be refunded immediately for the \"inconvenience\". After several weeks I recontacted BA and they said the complaint went to the wrong section and they were forwarding it to the next section. 6 weeks later and we still have not heard any updates except for a computer response stating most refunds were returned in 3 weeks, keep waiting. The plane then had ground difficulties and needed a quick repair. They completed that 30 minutes later and boarded the flight. The captain then came on and said it looks like they forgot to order the ground crew to back us out of the terminal and we needed to wait another 30 minutes. We were not able to make up for the lost time in the air. We landed 1.5 hours later than scheduled, wreaking havoc with our next flight.',\n",

       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  I decided to treat myself and my teenage daughter to World Traveller Plus on the return leg of our Canada holiday, paying hundreds of pounds extra to do so... only to end up spending nine and a half hours trapped in a broken seat staring at a blank screen after both our entertainment systems failed to work. I hadn't bought a book or uploaded a film because I had assumed I would be enjoying the entertainment BA had promised. So I decided to lie back and get some rest instead, only to discover that the leg rest on my seat didn't work. The flight attendant was able to prop it up manually by shoving things underneath, but unfortunately this only made matters worse because it became firmly stuck in the up position, forcing my body into an awkward position during the descent, when I had to keep my seatback upright, leaving me with back pain that lasted three days (I have a bad lower back). Early on in this experience I asked to be moved to economy so that I could sit normally and watch a film, but the flight was full and there was no space. The apologetic flight attendant assured me I would receive compensation, which I assumed meant the airline would, at the very least, upgrade us the next time we flew BA, since we had been unable to enjoy any of the advertised benefits of World Traveller Plus (the two of us only had one suitcase each, so hadn't made use of the extra baggage allowance). BA's actual compensation offer: £25 worth of Avios points each. I wrote back (since BA doesn't allow you to have any direct telephone contact with their complaints department) explaining firmly but politely that this was not fair or acceptable, given the hundreds of extra pounds I'd paid for added extras the airline had failed to deliver. They then ghosted me. My experience is a cautionary tale about British Airways customer support. If all goes to plan, you may well have a very pleasant World Traveller Plus experience. But if anything should go wrong, support staff will wash their hands of you and your money will have been wasted. So unless you're prepared to gamble, I would advise you to either stick with Economy/World Traveller (since then you're only really paying to fly from A to B, which they do manage to do) or fly with another airline. Or you could end up like me: throwing away extra money on an experience that fell far below the standard of economy class. If your flight is to Canada, I would recommend an airline such as Air Canada, which I turned to during the uncertainty of the Covid pandemic because of their exceptional customer service and fast, no-nonsense refunds. They do cost a bit more, so when life returned to normal post-Covid, I started flying BA again, believing such high standards of customer service were no longer important. I now see that this was both a mistake and a false economy - one that has ended up costing me hundreds of wasted pounds.\",\n",

The issue acknowledged by the captain is that the plane had been late since the morning flight from Rome with rolling effect until the evening. As this was the case, whey did BA not contact me and all other passengers, I could have made other arrangements and fly early to Istanbul and not miss my connection resulting in a £300 charge and a long delay. BA has certainly lots of staff who could have informed by using the email or text. Obviously passengers are of no utility to BA once the ticket is purchased. Who can trust BA to travel?

       " '✅ Trip Verified |   On arriving at Mexico Airport we were told that the flight was delayed because the aircraft had broken down and the replacement aircraft from LHR was about six hours late. When we eventually managed to check in we told that – contrary to the BA website – we could not have access to the 24-hour Grand Lounge Elite and instead would use the American Airlines Admirals Club lounge which would close three hours before the flight left. After that we would have to use a restaurant and were given a food voucher. Two hours before the flight was due to leave were then informed that the aircraft had diverted to Cancun because of a “volcanic ash cloud over Mexico City” – although it did not appear to be affecting other flights into the airport including those from Europe. They eventually arranged taxis to take us to a hotel and we arrived at 1.30am. We were assured that we would all be on a BA flight leaving the same time the following day. The only contact after that was a local employee who stayed at the hotel. He said that he was there to organise transport and refused to give us any other contact details. (When we eventually did need transport the following day he had disappeared.) During the night, we were then sent an email telling us that we were booked onto an Air Canada flight leaving at 6.30am. This would have been impossible with such short notice and without Canadian EPA authorisation. We then spent two hours trying to make contact with BA – its Mexico number did not work and eventually we were put on an Aeromexico flight in economy. They told us to check in as soon as we could but this meant we had to pay an extra £200 for the seats. Later, after a very long call, we were told that we could be upgraded to business with Aeromexico despite having been told earlier that there was no availability. BA then informed us that because we had already checked in – as they had suggested – we could not be moved and this took three more calls to Aeromexico to sort out. I totally understand that aircraft break down but the onus should be on the airline to rearrange and not the passengers. We were lucky because we took the trouble of making the calls to the UK but others – such as a disabled lady – had been told nothing when we left.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |   I have flown British Airways for many years and still do so regularly. In one of my last flights this past summer between Paris and Boston, British booked me on a connecting flight between Paris and London that gave me a maximum of 90 minutes to connect in London. London Heathrow is a massive airport where going from terminal to terminal could take 20-30 minutes once you deplane, not including the actual time to deplane if you are seated in the back and lines at passport control and security between terminals. So already, one is pressed for time. My flight from Paris to London that day was tardy, 49 minutes tardy that day to be exact. BA Flight 323 in fact, is routinely tardy. – don’t bother with this one. Flight Connections assisted me by calling the new gate to let them know my previous flight had been delayed and that I was rushing to the gate. It was 30 minutes before my connecting flight was to depart. I ran like a fool for 25 minutes, carryons and all, arriving to the gate 5 minutes before my flight was to depart, only to be greeted by no plane. The agent said that since no one knew where I was (false) the plane left without me – early. Gaining a few minutes was more important than an passenger inconvenienced by their own delay. So I made the 20 minute trek back to Flight Connections knowing that they would have to rebook me the following day. I was now going to miss the wedding I was destined to attend in Boston. They sent me to a prepaid Hilton hotel room for the night but told me that I would have to pay 30 pounds each way for a taxi to take me there. They gave me a pamphlet with instructions for reimbursement. This was in early July. It took me 4 months and a complaint to the British Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution to be reimbursed for the equivalent of $77. There was no apology, no recognition, not even a free drink coupon for that next flight I won’t ever take with British. Like a bad insurance claim, British just kept denying my claim, expecting that I would just go away. Well, I am going away. I’m taking my $77 and using another airline for future travel.',\n",

After boarding was complete we were told that departure was delayed because BA had not loaded all of the cargo; we were then told that it was delayed further because there was a fault with one of the fuel pumps. It took over five hours for this problem to be corrected as the pilot later informed us that they installed new pump having initially thought that it was a software issue. During that time we were served the meal but were told that alcohol is not permitted which was curious given that we had already been served a pre-departure drink. Most of the cabin crew were male and, apparently, based in Mexico and this turned out to be a pleasant surprise given that those I spoke to were incredibly positive and friendly but seemed embarrassed at what was happening.

A menu was also handed out not long after take off, the starter was quinoa and for main there was a choice of chicken, meatballs and pasta or a vegetarian mushroom dish. I chose the meatballs and they were really good. My only real complaint about the flight was people not getting the dish they wished for. We were sat in the last row of the premium economy cabin and by the time the meal service got to us all of the chicken dishes were gone. The moral of the story is that if you sit at the front of the cabin, you will likely get your preferred meal option. After the meal I chose to watch some shows on the well sized entertainment screen, BA is definitely up there for best inflight entertainment. Finally about an hour before landing we were served a breakfast snack, this come in the form of a warm egg and swiss cheese bagel. It was edible but also a little soggy and didn't really taste of much, I certainly wont be craving one anytime soon. We touched down into Heathrow on time before disembarking the aircraft and picking up our bags, everything was very efficient and we were on our way in no time.\",\n",

I am aware of the difficulties of flying with children, I know it is difficult to keep them entertained etc, I am a patient person, I have headphones. The parents of this child chose, despite a polite request, not to try and quieten their child at all. At this point one had an expectation the crew will step in. If I was singling loudly, disrupting other passengers, they would quite rightly ask me to desist. So why not speak to the parents of a child who is doing the same and disrupting the rest and sleep of other passengers? Instead, having served the meal, the crew retreated behind their curtain and left the passengers to stew. Simply not good enough. As for WiFi? Forget it...',\n",

After an hour in the tarmac the flight crews announce they were going to offer complimentary WATER? Really!! Another half hour goes by and they say the flight is cancelled, no reason at that time. As we wait for a bus to remove all passengers from the plane they announce that there will be staff members back at the gate to help with meal vouchers, taxi rides and hotel accommodations. WHAT? We get off the bus and there is a line of passengers trying to figure out what’s happening. Staff hands my wife and I a $10 meal voucher and says go upstairs and someone will help you with your issues. We go upstairs and nobody knows what to do. One staff member hands us a paper for a hotel room and tells us to get your luggage and keep your receipt for the taxi to be reimbursed. Nothing else. I asked about another flight and she said they will contact you asap. Who will contact?? And she walked away. We grabbed our luggage and headed to the taxi line. As we are being driven to the hotel I receive an email for our flight the next day on a different airline, Iberian? Our assigned seats are not together??

Approximately 1hr into the flight the pilot advised that as the weather radar wasn't working, we would be returning to Heathrow where we circled for approx 45 mins before landing. There was no member of staff present to offer advice about an alternative flights and the customer service desk stated they would not deal with it but we had to await an email.

This time we boarded approx 2 hrs late again the plane was at the gate but we had to wait for a crew.

With only eight seats in First Class, you would think they could provide a genuine \"white glove\" experience. Instead, the crew in First Class both ways were inattentive, ill-mannered, and badly trained. One gets better service in McDonalds. BA\\'s new First Suite is a small, uncomfortable cubicle, and miles behind premium classes at other airlines. Movie selection was very poor, and the wifi did not work properly. The amenity kit was tiny, and cheap. The airplane itself was dirty, and had clearly been cleaned in haste. The food served in First Class was grim, and especially bad on the ORD-LHR sector. The crew both sectors spent most of their time in the galley, and disappeared after the meal service. Overall, British Airways continues to decline, and one wouldn\\'t fly them if there was an alternative. To add insult to injury, BA flies into Chicago International Terminal, and has decided that the ORD-LHR return flies out of American Airlines Terminal 3, including use of the AA dreadful Flagship Lounge at T3. Of course, nothing will change, because governments have given BA a virtual monopoly, and BA continue to have mediocre leadership that only care about costs, and their own share portfolio.',\n",

I then had a close family member pass away suddenly to which I then offered my mother my ticket to fly out for the funeral, as I was told I could change the name. When then calling and trying to do this, I then got told that I was unable to do this unless we proved this by sending the death certificate as stated in the ‘policy’. After questioning this and not wanting to get false information, I made this representative double check and confirm this to which she did. After then troubling my aunt and uncle, who are grieving over the sudden loss of their son (my cousin) for this documentation, we then sent it to the to email provided and called to get this now changed into my mothers name. To which we then found out was yet ANOTHER lie and that this cannot be done as you can only change the name if the ticket holder has passed away (which makes no sense as they would be dead so how can they challenge a name change.) After expressing my feelings of mistrust, that I would be taking it further as I no longer wanting to have anything to do with this company, I was told that I wasn’t allowed any refund and was only allowed to book it at a later date. I then challenged the representative to speak to a manger to which I was told, they had none working, they had gone home and that no one had any direct email. After then putting in a formal complaint 5 MONTHS AGO WITH STILL NO RESPONSE. I called back to use the money to book a new flight to say I couldn't as it was a less amount (even after saying fine keep the remaining money) and I was only allowed to book the same amount or more (scam to get more money out of you). When asking to speak to a manager, shock horror, there isn't one working. When looking at the status of my complaint he said there is a back log and will get to it eventually (says a lot if the back log of complaints is longer than 5 months).

The lie-flat seats do that, as narrow as they are, and only by lowering the foot rest...the foot rest over which the person not on the aisle (I was on the aisle) has to step or crawl to get to the aisle. One can get a couple of fitful hours of sleep but only with luck. The seat controls on the A380 are primitive and antiquated. The food served was a bit better than coach but only minimally so.

There were three British Airways employees at the customer service desk when I was next in line at Heathrow, and two of them went on break despite the ever-growing line (due to multiple people missing their flights with the same airlines under similar circumstances). After 45 additional minutes waiting for assistance, I was given a receipt -not a boarding pass, which caused issues at the next connecting flight from Barcelona to Rome, which was coordinated through British Airways. And this was just on the outbound trip! On the return trip, the British Airways flight ended up landing 15 minutes late and landed while my connecting flight was boarding—downstairs from the exit gate. I was denied entry to my connecting flight because I was 15 minutes past the time when they started to board, because of the delay by British airways. The boarding didn’t close for an hour and didn’t leave for another hour and a half later (according to the notifications on my phone). So, instead of being helped, I was denied entry because I missed the beginning of boarding by 15 minutes due to the connecting flight delay. Again, I waited in the customer service line at Heathrow to reschedule my flight. I already had my boarding pass in hand! I still haven’t made it to my final destination.  I do not recommend Heathrow Airport either. The British Airlines employee came to me when she saw me upset after being denied to board on my return flight, and asked what happened. Her solution to my problem was do not fly British Airways in the future. Thanks a lot, lady. I already figured that out on my own.

The crew kept saying that no rebooking was possible apart from the automated one (which expected us to cross Europe to get to our destination) and no hotel booking were in their power either. Well: liars. After hours of pushing and raging, one person came with the hotel bookings for roughly those 30 of us who kept on fighting. Liars also for another reason: all but one angel told us there was no way to be rebooked. But one took me apart and suggested me a way, which worked. It meant breaking some of their “rules” but after all they made the mess, so they had to sort it out. With 3 hours of sleep over 24 hours I managed to get back where I had to and I’m 100% committed to now avoid BA as much I shall be able to. Some of the clerks told me it was impossible working for them after all the cuts to save on money, as the company runs in pretty bad financial waters. Hubs such as Heathrow now have almost no presence and passengers have to do all by themselves, from checking in their bags at the bag drops to spending hours on their phones at their expenses when BA messes it up as it frequently does lately.

       " '✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways oversold my LHR to LAX flight; I booked months in advance paid in full and actually paid over $1000 extra to fly their Airbus A380. Tried to check in online day before flight, got unknown system error couldn’t check in. Arrived at LHR 3.5 hours early; none of BA kiosks worked, all manual check in by understaffed BA staff who were all unhelpful. Insane queue times; lots of other frustrated passengers in line. Denied boarding at the gate because flight oversold, no explanations, no apologies, constantly ignored by BA staff who don’t have the patience to listen to your situation or be helpful. Finally gate manager books alternate flight to Paris CDG, supposedly to connect with an Air France flight. We get to CDG only to be told by Air France their flight was full; no idea why BA manager bumped me to AF flight that’s also full! That’s insult to injury to be bumped twice! Went to BA desk at CDG, no help at all they told us to call BA and couldn’t even provide the phone number; just told us to look online. On top of all that my luggage is lost somewhere between BA and AF in Paris CDG. I’m an American citizen and speak perfect English, but I feel completely humiliated and treated like second class citizen by multiple BA staff through the whole ordeal. Mostly they just ignore you or bounce you from one counter to another without even trying to listen to your problem. Zero accountability. Will never ever fly BA again! Absolute worst travel experience of my life.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled London to Doha on July 16th, I had to physically check in at BA Business T5 because I had an ongoing connection in Doha and the flight was a code share with Qatar. I had paid for my flight through Qatar and paid for the seat online so I could sit where I like to sit and when I got to check in discovered I had been reseated elsewhere in the cabin and was told that was their policy and basically to shut up about it. I then discovered that BA do not recognise Qatar frequent flyer rules despite sharing Avios points. I\\'m a Gold card holder in Qatar which affords me extra kilos on the baggage but BA tried to tell me I had to pay. After some arguing eventually they accepted it! The Lounge was packed, staff less than helpful when I tried to get some answers on my seat reassignment, I was told I would get my money back - no chance of that so don\\'t even try. The flight boarded by bus, the journey took 15 minutes to get from terminal to aircraft which I am guessing was at another terminal because it took so long to get there. Why not board us through that terminal rather than drag us all over the airport? Finally got onto the plane, BA staff are not friendly, it\\'s no wonder they are ranked 13th, I now realise it\\'s a privilege being allowed to step onto a BA flight and it departed 90+ minutes late. Myself and many other travellers had connections and this meant I was either going to miss the connection or I would manage to make the connection but my luggage wouldn\\'t. Would BA flight crew help me on board to figure out the connection? they eventually came to tell me me in their haughty attitude, \"We are now landing 15 minutes earlier so that give you a full 50 minutes to make your connection\" Landing early does not mean getting to the gate earlier, it usually takes at least 10 minutes from landing to gate, then another 7 for the jetway to be attached and if you are lucky to be sitting near the door straight off, if not 20 minutes to disembark, if you want to be helpful don\\'t say stupid things to people who are frequent travellers! As it turned out I was sitting near the door and had to run off the plane, Qatar were there to assist but I did have to run from the A gates all the way to C gates to make my connection, not a short distance for a 70+ year old and the luggage did not make it. Many others were not as fortunate and didn\\'t make their connections. Why put a page in the flight entertainment for connections if you are not going to provide the information, it\\'s public information you can look it up on line, so the aircraft has access to WiFi and satellite communication so I fail to understand why this information cannot be captured and displayed? I complained to BA got a wishy washy email with a number of excuses in it, no mention of the seat refund. I got a paltry voucher that I\\'m supposed to use on another BA flight - who are they kidding I am not sure I want to experience that again. However I have recently discovered that of my frequently travelled to destinations is really only serviced by BA if I want to fly at a reasonable hour of the day or go all over Europe just to avoid them which is too expensive. I consider them one of the worst airlines I have ever flown and getting worse by the minute. Fly them only if you absolutely have to and good luck.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  When dropping off my luggage at the luggage drop off at Toulouse airport, I had my travel pram confiscated from me and I was forced to take my sleeping 2 year old in my arms while traveling alone with him at 5.30am. I was told by the staff outsourced by British Airways to check in passengers that only yoyo prams were accepted on board. I corrected her that it was \"yoyo type\" prams but she contested and told me that only yoyo prams would be allowed and if I insisted to keep my sleeping 2-year-old in his pram I would not be permitted to board the flight to London. This happened to 2 other families and we were forced to go to the oversized baggage area of the airport. To clarify my pram is the Silver Cross Jet stroller pushchair which I specifically purchased as it is conform to the British Airways specifications. I was then required to carry my toddler for 30 mins through security, and then again for another 40 mins while waiting to board the plane (I was \"allowed\" early boarding only to be moved from my seat to stand on the other side of the staff with no more options to sit down). At Heathrow, I was then required to carry my toddler again for approx. 40 mins to go through passport check and luggage claim (as mentioned previously, I was traveling alone with my child with no other support). All this, despite purchasing a very expensive pram to fit to your requirements and coming to the airport prepared with this pram. I\\'m sure you agree this is unacceptable and it is illegal to force passengers to purchase a specific brand of products in order to be able to keep their child in their travel pram.  In addition to this, once on the plane, I installed my Kids Fly Safe Cares Child Airplane Safety Harness for my son. The cabin crew then proceeded to tell me this was not allowed. I had to go on the website to show them that this was incorrect and I was in fact within my rights. Then, for landing, the crew had the gall to tell me to put the harness on my son and that it was mandatory to which I asked, if it was mandatory why did I bring the harness myself. British Airways is the most discriminatory airline for parents traveling with children and this needs to change. My advice; don\\'t treat a mom traveling alone at 5am with a sleeping toddler like rubbish, and don\\'t confiscate her travel pram that is within regulation forcing her to have the worst travel experience possible.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified | If you can’t fly First Class don’t fly British Airways! VERY uncomfortable seats. You can’t even get out of your seat when the person in front has their seat reclined (and who doesn’t need to recline their seat!) You can’t pick up ANYTHING off the floor during the flight because you can’t bend to touch the floor - there isn’t enough space to! If you have long legs don’t think you are going to be comfortable - as soon as the person in front of you puts their chair back your knees WILL be CRUSHED! Terrible food, Terrible plane, Terrible air-hostesses, Terrible flight and unfortunately I have to fly back home with them.',\n",
       " \"Not Verified |   Singapore to Heathrow. Business class on an A380-800 is a Premium Economy Plus experience. From the economy class sized toilets to the badly designed coffin shaped Business class pods - the experience is a substandard business class experience. Business class pod’s storage is a small drawer at the FOOT of the pod. The ‘privacy’ screens are opaque plastic sheets - so you are kept awake by your neighbour as their screen lights up your pod. When the seat is made into its coffin shaped bed - the cold hard plastic seat moulds are an unpleasant surprise for those that turn in their sleep. You have a choice of having your neighbour step over your calf-height footrest - hopefully not brushing your feet with theirs - or having to step over your neighbour's feet/footrest. With the footrest down - heaven-forbid you try to lever yourself into a more comfortable position as the slightest pressure causes the footrest to collapse into its floor level position. If you are in the aisle seat - which is open to the aisle - kiss goodbye to any privacy as not only will you be on view to all passengers - the crew will lean you to both serve your neighbour their food and talk to your neighbour over your privacy screen.\",\n",
       " \"Not Verified |   I reported my damaged/ruined suitcase 5 weeks ago and I'm still awaiting a reply. I'll think twice about booking with BA again as the Customer Service is shocking to say the least. I've followed up with British Airways with at least 3 emails per week requesting an update but with no joy so far.\",\n",
       " \"Not Verified |\\xa0 \\xa0On March 1st, I flew from Berlin to São Paulo with BA but encountered several issues. My first flight was delayed by several hours, causing me to miss my connection at London Heathrow. Upon arriving at the airport after midnight, I was given a hotel voucher. However, the hotel designated by BA rudely denied me check-in, claiming it was fully booked. I had to return to Heathrow at 1 AM and found a different hotel, paying for the taxi out of my own pocket. As a result of these complications, I arrived in São Paulo more than 24 hours late. Despite my efforts to assert my rights and seek reimbursement for the taxi, BA's customer service has been extremely poor. Their phone lines are non-functional, emails are only answered automatically, and the appropriate channels for such requests have not been responsive since the first week of March. This experience has left me extremely disappointed, especially considering the high standard of service I once associated with BA.\",\n",
       " \"Not Verified | The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution. \",\n",

       " '✅ Trip Verified | Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service.',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified | This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days.\",\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA.\"]"
